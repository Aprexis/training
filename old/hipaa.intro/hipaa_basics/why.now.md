There are 3 main reasons HIPAA is getting so much attention right now, and is something you should understand if you want to get into healthcare.

1. **HITECH Act**. The HITECH Act was a part of the large Americal Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed in 2009. The HITECH Act committed over $25 billion to increase the adoption of health information technology.

	The HITECH Act has been a catalyst for the goldrush in electronic health record (EHR) adoption and sales. Healthcare organizations must install EHRs that meet specific requirements of called [Meaningful Use](https://catalyze.io/blog/2014-predictions-meaningful-use-continues-to-challenge-it-departments/). Meaningful use, at a very high level, attempts to make clinical data exchange more standardized, supporting standards for the formats and types of electronic data exchange.
	
	As more health data becomes digital, there is a massive opportunity for new technologies that leverage that data, or help collect that data. This is one of the main reasons healthcare technology is such a hot field right now for entreprenuers and investors.
	
2. **Changing Reimbursement and Incentives**. Along with HITECH, the healthcare system is seeing a wave of new changes in the way that healthcare services are paid for, and changes in how providers (health systems, hospitals) are incented. As opposed to traditional fee for service models, [new models of care](https://catalyze.io/blog/changing-reimbursement-means-new-opportunities/) are emerging that reward quality care, cost savings, and making the patient experience a happier one. This shift, which is still in its infancy, is driving new technology enabled care delivery models like telemedicine, as more and more healthcare organizations seek to improve overall care quality at lower costs.

	In this space, there are no clear winners and the market opportunities are massive since healthcare is about 17% of the US GDP.

3. **New HIPAA Rules**. In 2013, new HIPAA rule went into effect. These rules get bundled into what is called the HIPAA Omnibus Rule. The Omnibus Rule was included as part of the HITECH Act.

	Readers of this guide should care about HIPAA, assuming they feel #1 and #2 above are convincing reasons to build technology to deliver on new requirements in healthcare, because HIPAA rule changes as part of the Omnibus rule cause 1) an expansion of the scope of HIPAA to include services providers and hosting companies, and 2) and increase in the fines for violating HIPAA.
