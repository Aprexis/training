# Notifications

HIPAA requires notification of a breach “without unreasonable delay” but allows, at a maximum, 60 days to report a known breach. Most covered entities that we’ve worked with want that timeline to be much shorter, and the range we usually hear is somewhere between 24 hours and 5 days. This can be a sticking point in business associate discussions. Some hosting providers have polices in place for breach reporting that are 30 days, 45 days, even 60 days out; this is typically not in line with what a hospital or a payer or another large enterprise in healthcare would expect from a business associate agreement and a breach policy for a business associate that they are working with. Despite the 60 day window HIPAA rules also go on to require “evidence demonstrating the necessity of any delay.” If it takes 60 days, there have to be reasons given for that delay.

Breach policy and breach notification are things that are extremely important. There are templates for breach notification, but the policy alone does not mitigate risk. There needs to be an understanding within the organization, business associate or covered entity, of what a breach is and what the breach policy is. There also need to be auditing and logging and other systems (IDS) in place to detect and investigate a breach. Detecting the breach is often the challenge which is why having a comprehensive audit log is necessary and more importantly, being able to generate alerts off the log is critical.
