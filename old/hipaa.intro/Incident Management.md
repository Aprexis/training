# Incident Management

Catalyze implements an information security incident response process to consistently detect, respond, and report incidents, minimize loss and destruction, mitigate the weaknesses that were exploited, and restore information system functionality and business continuity as soon as possible.

Your responsibilities in this context are:
- If you detect any unauthorized or suspicious activity / access of our (or our customers systems) that has not been detected by the IDS or other protections, then immediately report it to management, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer.
- Since you detected the event, you might be called upon to be part of the Security Incident Response Team [SIRT](https://catalyze.io/policy/#security-incident-response-team-(sirt&#41;)
