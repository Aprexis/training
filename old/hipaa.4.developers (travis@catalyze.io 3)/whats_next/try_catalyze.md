# Try Catalyze!

We created Catalyze to make it simpler to deploy, scale, and manage compliant applications.

###Mobile Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
With our **backend-as-a-service model (BaaS)**, customers can build full-features, comliant apps using our APIs and mobile SDKs. You can add users, store data and files, manage access controls, and utilize validated data models tailor made for health and wellness data. It's fast and simple to get up and running, and we have customers that have built compliant mobile apps in an afternoon. We have a free developer plan (without a BAA), and paid plans starting at $100/month, BAA included. Learn more or signup [here](https://catalyze.io/backend-as-a-service/)!

###Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
With our **platform-as-a-service (PaaS)**, customers can deploy and host their applications (Ruby, Node, Java, Go, PHP, etc) and databases (Postgres, MySQL, Mongo, Riak, Redis, etc) in a compliant network, with services mapped specifically to HIPAA requirements - encryptions (at rest and in transit), backup, monitoring, logging, file integrity checking, vulnerability scanning, disaster recovery, and a host of other services. You can scale up horizontally, by adding additional servers, or vertically, by moving to more powerful servers. Learn more or signup [here](https://catalyze.io/platform-as-a-service/)!
