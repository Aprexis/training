# Datica HIPAA Training Docs

![status](https://codeship.com/projects/11f09820-66f6-0133-fd05-5ef847086c15/status?branch=master)

This is an overview training of HIPAA, with coverage of key definitions and provisions for the handing of HIPAA-relevant data. The material in this book is intended for individuals who work for organizations that provide technology and technology-enabled services to health systems, payers, physicians, pharma, and other healthcare organizations. It leans more heavily on the use of modern, cloud-based technologies than traditional client side software.
