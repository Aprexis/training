# Definition of Breach

A breach is defined as unauthorized exposure of ePHI or disclosure thatâ€™s not authorized or allowed under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. The breach rules were amended in 2013 as part of the HITECH Act.

HITECH Act Sec. 13402(b) Notification of Covered Entity by Business Associate states - A business associate of a covered entity that accesses, maintains, retains, modifies, records, stores, destroys, or otherwise holds, uses, or discloses unsecured protected health information shall, following the discovery of a breach of such information, notify the covered entity of such breach. Such notice shall include the identification of each individual whose unsecured protected health information has been, or is reasonably believed by the business associate to have been, accessed, acquired, or disclosed during such breach.
