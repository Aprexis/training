# Introduction

This training is meant to act as a guide to developers and modern technology vendors that are building and selling technology for healthcare. While the training covers some generic topics on HIPAA, it is not intended to replace an introductory training for HIPAA. It is intended to be a playbook for vendors looking to go beyond checking the boxes, and provide a guides, and associated recommendations, based on what we've learned at Catalyze.

Much of our experience at Catalyze has been shaped by our experience with auditors and enterprises, both of which have required policies, procedures, and technical specifications. This is the playbook we wish we had when we started building compliant technology, and we hope it's of value to others doing the same. We do not hide our opinions, and in many respects have strong views on compliance.

If you're looking for an overview and introduction to HIPAA, something that can give you a form of completion to meet HIPAA 164.530(i) training requirements, please refer to this [training](https://training.catalyze.io/).
