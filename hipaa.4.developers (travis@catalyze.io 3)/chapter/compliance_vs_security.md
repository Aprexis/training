# Compliance vs Security

##Key Points
* **Compliance** is checking a box, a box you must check to sell into healthcare, to provide assurances and legal obligations to protect certain kinds of healthcare data.
* **Security** is implementing technology and processes to  protect data and systems from unauthorized access.

##How they are the same

* They are both **ongoing and dynamic**. They should not be seen as a point in time, or doing something for an audit. Good information security and maintaining compliance with HIPAA should be continous.
* Both require a lot of **documentation**.
* Both are rolled up into complimentary departments at large healthcare enterprises.

##The Major Differences

Security and Compliance are not the same, despite often being lumped together. Ideally something that is "HIPAA-compliant" should also be secure, but that doesn't always hold true. And something can be super secure, with all real risks mitigated, but not be compliant. We've been through enough audits to know that some of the best information security practices and features we have are never asked about or documented to show compliance.

Compliance, by design, is prescriptive. It includes a set of standards, rules, and/or requirements that can be used to score an entity. In the case of HIPAA, much of it is high level so it is still interpreted, but it's a framework to assess, or audit against.

Security is not prescriptive, despite there being best practicses.

Compliance will never fully and completely capture information security.
