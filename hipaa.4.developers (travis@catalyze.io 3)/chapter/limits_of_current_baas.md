# Limits of Current BAAs

The main questions relate to responsibility and risk exposure. At the end of they day, it's the covered entity, and likely the compliance office at the covered entity, that is going to decide what is acceptable for its business associates, and in turn what is acceptable for the subcontractors of its business associates. In the case of many compliant cloud infrastructure providers, the BAAs they sign assume limited risk and leave much of the technical responsibility, and associated risk of a breach, on the customers that use them (Vendor A in example above); we created Catalyze to provide a more sane approach to compliance, acting as more of a partner and full service compliance platform, with the associate risk that entails, to make it simpler to utilize the cloud in a compliant way.
