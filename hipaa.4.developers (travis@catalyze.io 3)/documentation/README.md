# Non-technical Requirements

##Key Points

* HIPAA is part technical and non-technical, but all aspects of HIPAA require a lot of documentation.
* Define your documentation process up front, and stick to it.
* To get a sense of the total amount of policies required for an audit, look at the [Catalyze policy page](https://catalyze.io/policy/) or go look at [open source versions](https://catalyze.io/policy/) of our policies you can use as templates.

--------------------

Compliance and security are different things, but both involve a lot of documentation. Lots of HIPAA is documentation - about your organization, about your technology, and about the processes that are in place to secure health data from unauthorized access. In addition to policies and procedures (P&Ps), almost everything you do should be documented. It's a lot of work, and a lot of content, so defining the process and structure for how you document is crucial or you'll quickly have a mess of content all over the place, and managing it will be more work that creating it.

At Catalyze, we learned this with experience, and now have a good process in place to quickly track and update our documentation. We use Github for version control, and publish our [policies](https://catalyze.io/policy/) on our website. We are also heavy users of Google Forms and Spreadsheets for access requests, change tracking, and other ongoign reporting.

The sections below are the major non-technical sections of HIPAA to which you should be concerned. Some are not explicit in HIPAA, but will be required if you decide to do a 3rd party audit, and are the way that good information security should be done anyway.
