# Documentation

Compliance and security are different things, but both involve a lot of documentation. The majority of HIPAA is documentation - about your organization, about your technology, and about the processes that are in place to secure health data. Almost everything you do should be documented, so defining the process and structure for how your document is crucial or you'll quickly have a mess of content all over the place, and managing it will be more work that creating it.

At Catalyze, we learned this with experience, and now have a good process in place to quickly track and update our documentation. We use Github for version control, and publish our [policies](https://catalyze.io/policy/) on our website. We are also heavy users of Google Forms and Spreadsheets for requests and change tracking.

The sections below are the major sections of documentation for HIPAA. Some are not explicit in HIPAA, but will be required if you decide to do a 3rd party audit.
