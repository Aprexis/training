# Ongoing tracking

##Key Points


##What and how to track

If you ask people in healthcare about HIPAA, the typical things you'll hear about are BAAs, risk assessments, and maybe a few technical requirements like encryption, logging and backup. At Catalyze, our leadership team has deep domain experience in information security, and info sec is where many of us spent years of our profession lives. We also have healthcare experience and health tech experience, so we understood BAAs and risk assessments as a key component of compliance.

What we did not fully appreciate was the amount of additional tracking that is required for good organizational security tracking and monitoring. We've quickly learned that we need to track, to a pretty fervent degree, things like:

* granting and changing access to systems and applications;
* tracking changes and reviews of policies;
* keeping track of system deployments and decommisioning;
* employee onboarding specific to HIPAA;
* reporting of incidents; and
* a host of other things related both to information security and data privacy.

We did not discover an app for all of this. Compliance management tools are new, and all of the ones we found only get you to a risk assessment. Risk assessments are necessary, but they are not everything.

What we do at Catalyze is use Google Spreadsheets to create the necessary forms for tracking ongoing compliance- and security-related things. These are all a part of a compliance folder that is readable by only our Privacy Officer and Security Officer. And they are part of checklists that, not surprisingly, are also Google Spreadsheets and Forms. We then use Google Calendar to schedule regular reviews and link the calendar events to the Forms. It works well, though it's hardly repeatable and not something we can open source.

We would encourage anybody to do this from the start, as building tracking and documentation into your process early make life a lot easier later. If you have specific questions or what examples of our forms and data we capture, email us at [hipaa@catalyze.io](hipaa@catalyze.io).
