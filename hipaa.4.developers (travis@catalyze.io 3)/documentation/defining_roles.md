# Defining Roles

##Key Points
* Define the roles and responsilibities for a Security Officer at your organization.
* Assign an individual, and make sure that person knows you've assigned him or her, as the Security Officer for you organization.

##Policies

This one is really easy. The Security Officer is basically the goto guy when it comes to HIPAA at your organization. If you're wildly successful you might one day have a compliance officer, but that's pretty unlikely until you get a lot bigger.

Some common roles of the Security Officer include:

* Creating and tracking training;
* Managing responses to security incidents;
* Reviewing and changing polocies;
* Granting access to authorized individuals.

You can see the responsibilities of our Security Officer at Catalyze [here](https://www.catalyze.io/policy/#security-officer). We do a lot of audits, and because we work closely on compliance with customers and customers' customers, we also have a Privacy Officer, with roles defiend [here](https://www.catalyze.io/policy/#privacy-officer).
