#The mission of the Catalyze PaaS


###Maximize Security
Security and compliance are at the core of what we provide. So everything that we do has to have those two goals in mind. Our customers manage sensitive data. It is our responsibility to ensure the highest level of security possible while mitigating whatever possible attack surfaces that we are aware of. That also implies that we continue to monitor, test and secure our PaaS to ensure that we continue to provide the highest level of security possible.


###Simplify Compliance
Compliance with regulations is challenging. It is our responsibility to stay abreast of these regulations and implement them as much as possible into the offering. Policies put into place internally are **important** and there for a reason. Adherence to them is essential for **our** business continuity so please take them seriously.


###Parity with "mainstream" software development
Software development platforms like Heroku and Parse revolutionized software development. It is our intention and mission to bring that same revolution to healthcare software development.


###Rival Heroku in ease of use and reliability
They are the gold standard for Platform as Service at scale. We should plan to exceed their capabilities at every level.
