HIPAA stands for the **H**ealth **I**nsurance **P**ortability and **A**ccountability **A**ct. If you’re not familiar with **HIPAA**, or you haven’t spent a lot of time in the healthcare industry, you may not realize that spelling “HIPAA” wrong is a running joke. Most people, especially in IT, will have some story about a consultant or vendor delivering a report or sending emails with HIPAA spelled wrong. I can remember doing my first HIPAA audit at HCA as a consultant, way back before I went to medical school or knew what an EHR was, and having to do a find-and-replace to assure we caught any misspellings of “HIPAA” before submitting the report to HCA. Just remember it’s not like “hippo” - there’s only one “P."

What’s interesting about the acronym “HIPAA” is that the “P” in HIPAA does not stand for “privacy” and the “I” does not stand for “information." It’s interesting because the general perception of HIPAA, which is accurate, is that its main purpose is to “protect” health “information." The reason for this perception is that the protection of health information is essential to avoid financial penalties for breaches and non-compliance with HIPAA.

While much of HIPAA, especially as it is enforced by compliance officers at large healthcare organizations to avoid financial risk, is about securing data and not releasing it unless authorized, HIPAA also sets rules around how data is exchanged between systems and how authorizations are done to allow for access to individual medical records.

The one other essential acronym with HIPAA is *PHI*. PHI stands for Protected Health Information. PHI is often referred to as “personal health information," which is an accurate description of PHI. PHI is simple - it’s the combination of a personal identifier (name, DOB, SSN, IP address, email, etc) with some health-related data (condition, medication, lab, encounter, health payment, etc).

The spirit of HIPAA is simple -
1. to secure and protect personal health information and
2. to enforce standards for electronic transactions in healthcare
