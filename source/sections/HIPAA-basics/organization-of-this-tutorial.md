# Organization of this tutorial

We created this tutorial at Datica because we wanted something that we could distribute to all new hires to give them a crash course on HIPAA. While it's true there are plenty of HIPAA training options, both free and paid, we didn't feel that any were created for employees of modern health technology vendors. As we talked to early customers and prospects, we also realized that we were getting asked the same questions about HIPAA time and time again.

Seeing an opportunity to help the industry and ideally reduce the barriers to people coming into healthcare from outside the industry, both things we're passionate about at Datica, we decided to reuse some of our existing content, from our blog, and generate a bunch of new content. If you have feedback or suggestions, please [email](mailto:training@datica.com) us.

We've tried to organize this in the most logical way possible. Each section below has multiple subsections, and we provide links to additional resources at the end. There is a quiz towards the end, which is meant to force you to actively engage, and break up the passive nature of the training.
