# Organization of this tutorial

We created this tutorial at Catalyze because we wanted something that we could distribute to all new hires to give them a crash course on HIPAA. While it's true there are plenty of HIPAA training options, both free and paid, we didn't feel that any was created for employees of modern health technology vendors. As we talked to early customers and prospects, we also realized that we were getting asked the same questions about HIPAA time and time again.

Seeing an opportunity to help the industry and ideally reduce the barriers to people coming into to healthcare from outside the industry, both things we're passionate about at Catalyze, we decided to reuse some of our existing content, from our blog, and generate a bunch of new content. If you have feedback or suggestions, please [email](training@catalyze.io) us.

We've tried to organize this in the most logical way possible. Each section below has multiple subsections, and we provide links to additional resources at the end. There are exercise sprinkled throughout, which are meant force you to actively engage, and break up the passive nature of the training.
