# Business Associates

The HIPAA Privacy Rule outlines the types of entities that are covered by HIPAA and entities that have to follow the HIPAA security and privacy rules. The main categories are clearinghouses, covered entities (CEs) - typically hospitals, payers, and providers, and business associates. Business associates are far away the biggest cohort of cloud computing companies.

Business associates are people or organizations who contract and provide services and/or technology for covered entities. In the process of providing those services or those technologies, business associates handle, process, transmit, or in some way interact with electronic protected health information (ePHI) from those covered entities. With this ePHI access, business associates are required to sign whatâ€™s called a business associate agreement (BAA).

Catalyze is a subcontractor for some of our customers and, as such, we do sign BAAs. We also act as a business associate directly for covered entities like enterprises, and sign BAAs in this capacity as well. We offer the same compliant software in both circumstances, but the relationship is slightly different in the eyes of HIPAA.
