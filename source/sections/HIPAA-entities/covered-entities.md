# Covered Entities

What is a "covered entity" under HIPAA?

The term "covered entity" under the HIPAA Privacy Rule refers to three specific groups, including health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers that transmit health information electronically.  Covered entities under the HIPAA Privacy Rule must comply with the Rule's requirements for safeguarding the privacy of protected health information.  Below is a more detailed list of those who fall under the covered entity category under HIPAA.

- Health Plans (licensed insurers, ERISA plans, HMOs, Medicare, etc.)
- Providers (physicians, hospitals, home health, DME, pharmacy, chiropractic, dental, etc.) that conduct one or more of the HIPAA-defined transactions electronically
- Clearinghouses (billing services, value-added networks and switches if these entities perform clearinghouse functions such as claims routing, and cleansing entities)
