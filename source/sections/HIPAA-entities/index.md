HIPAA defines entities in two broad buckets:

1. **Covered Entities**. Health systems, payers, and clearinghouses (process claims) fall into this category. If you’re curious, here’s an official [site](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/index.html) that helps you determine if you’re a covered entity.

2. **Business Associates**. These, most likely you if you’re reading this, are entities that provide services to covered entities and through those services access, transmit, process, or store PHI. Changes to HIPAA that went into effect in the fall of 2013 expanded the definition of business associate to include *“subcontractors,”* or entities that provide services to business associates. A simple use case - a developer that builds a PHR for a hospital is a business associate, and the hosting provider that the developer uses (ideally Datica) is a subcontractor. The developer signs a BAA with the hospital and with the hosting provider, again ideally Datica.
